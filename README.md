Enjoy our graphs, we had a lot of fun making them! 

The data comes from Rebrickable! [here](https://rebrickable.com/)

Once we were knitting the entire document we realized there is a weird interaction between the networkD3 package and the circlepackeR package where the radial networks interfered with the rendering of the circle graphs. Therefore the radial network is in a seperate html file title radial_network.
